        "lyrics": "I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye I saw a pretty little thing approaching me She said, \"I never seen a man, who looks so all alone Oh, could you use a little company? If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice And you can go and send me on my way.\" I said, \"You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?\" She looked at me and this is what she said: \"Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed There ain't nothing in this world for free Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back Though you know, I wish I could Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good\" Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight He said, \"Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice\" I told him, \"You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask What made you want to live this kind of life?\"   He said, \"There ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed There ain't nothing in this world for free Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back Though you know, I wish I could Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good\" Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house The day was winding down and coming to an end And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills You know there ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed There ain't nothing in this world for free Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back Though you know we wish we could Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good"

What's it feel like? Took the wrong route Watch it fall apart Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate For you to pay the toll A price for you alone The only deal you'll find I'll gladly take your soul While it seems sick Sober up quick Psycho lunatic Crushing you with hands of fate Shame to find out when it's too late But you're all the same Trapped inside inferno awaits Evil thoughts can hide I'll help release the mind I'll peel away the skin Release the dark within This is now your life Strike you from the light This is now your life Die buried alive This is now your life (what's it feel like?) Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul) This is now your life (what's it feel like?) Die buried alive (let me take in your soul) This is now your life Die buried alive"

(What you want) (What you want) (Got something to say) (Got something to say) (Alright) (Can you fill me in)   Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out I'd say \"hey girl, come on right around\" So she knocked at the door I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw The club we went in We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm Saw it was early morning Thought we'd better be leavin' So I gave you my jacket for you to hold Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools We were just doing things young people in love do Parents tryna find out what we were up to Saying why can't you keep your promises no more Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door Can you fill me in? Wearing a jacket, who's property Said you'd been queuing for a taxi But you left all your money on the TV Can you fill me in? Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light Now you're dressed in black When I left you were dressed in white Can you fill me in?

        "lyrics": "I said friends come and go But music gon' be up on the Internet forever When did opinions become facts all together Criticizing your work don't make add up as lessor They patting niggas like leather cause I'm From a state where they never escape Only bad part about the great moments Is the knowing that I never could stay And shake everybody's hand Since when did my destination need measuring tape you a melancholy man Don't make my lane full of sorrow I bring to the table like paint brushes On Leonardo Da Vinci I took a slice way deeper than from Sbarro You never know with the Lord Got on the page for tomorrow and simply I told my heart to keep loving The struggle told me to stop working I've been through it so much Y'all air been killing my lungs Y'all pollute it so much Heart turned to a Kool Aid pitcher I pour it so much And it's full of cups that you know I'm supplying Nowadays a album drops and I don't get all excited ya'll growing up the same Don't try to blame it on science Need my soul through the timing Like a kitchen appliance Industry a be silent If I say you misguided See success every time I look inside of my eyelid I be making kids days really just by replying They react like Hulk Hogan Slammed Andre the Giant I just want to give my mama everything she gave me times infinity Once I ate I lay down so what I'm a say now is it a eight laid down is infinity I found my purpose to the kids Life will smoothen itself to another field Once you finalize your matter I'm a keep climbing to infinity and once I get there I'm a find another ladder I ain't running out of data   I've been trying to write this song for a minute Want the world inside my palm for minute Hoping I can supersede and get everything you need I've been praying on it strong for minute I love you times infinity Don't mind believing don't mind I love you times infinity Don't mind believing all my distortion When I was young my dreams I always say in plural And I was constantly on the move when I played deferral I would ask for the chalk over crayons every day Just so I can go outside and try to paint the world Now I'm putting things in a view That my old job was really karma in a way Cause I thought I was doing something But nothing was taking place When little bro was tryna to play the game Over and over when you let them play You ain't really connect the controller It figures The goal is to feed your fam forever Off what you love doing We put on earth to help each other But it's phonies that camp on your negatives Find it fun doing Winners don't worry bout others that's winning 95% of the ocean is undiscovered Don't let these people tell you ain't no room for you outta judgement Nigga you feel it's authentic Every time I be saying I got you How I'm a quit when I inspire others to not to Continue on the push so I don't try to celebrate We getting old quick so make it happen yesterday The truth is that I deliver I don't try to decorate No smoking on the plane so I got it squared away Ya'll under estimate the power of hugs Which clarifies disinfection inside of my lungs That I breathe in from environment issues That explains why you never can be quiet with sniffles I just want to give my fam everything they gave me times infinity I just want to give my fam I just want to give my grams everything she gave me times infinity I found my purpose through the love Life will smoothin it's self to another field once you finalize your matter I'm a keep climbing to infinity and once I get there I'm a find another letter I ain't in this for the chatter I've been trying to write this song for a minute Want the world inside my palm for minute Hoping I can supersede and get everything you need I've been praying on it strong for minute I love you times infinity Don't mind believing don't mind I love you times infinity Don't mind believing all my distortion"

Make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden I'll make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden   So when I close my eyes I can see the other side's a tidal wave Always feeling like I am asleep even when I'm awake None of this is real, I'm convinced that it is make-believe And that I died and now I reside inside a fever dream I take amphetamines 'cause I don't wanna sleep again I'm movin' out of Elm Street 'cause I don't want to eat with them I feel this grease deep within tuggin' at my arteries Eating at my insides, takin' every part of me Until there is nothing left, walk the street with skeleton feet Blood on my face like when a predator eats I'm at my apex and I've assumed my final form Primal force take your brain right off of your spinal cord I'm that extra set of footsteps creakin' your vinyl floor When you're home alone snatch you up before you reach your mobile phone No sign of struggle, curtain blowin' in the breeze With an extra set of footprints leading into the trees I'm gone! Make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden I'll make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden That sweet boom bap pound, that's the sound of my people I'll fuckin' walk the streets, a priest with chalk releasing ancient evil When I was young, I was a terror, I grew up to be a terrorist Rip out the fuckin' tongue and twist the necks of all my therapists I've seen the end of times, that's why I'll die a fuckin' pessimist Manipulating matter, I sit with the fourth one Erebus Conversing how his daughter is my nemesis I gained my powers back and now the bitch sense that I exist I like the happiness I lack, don't need her fuckin' with my balance So can you hide me in the dark? Are you up for the challenge? He said it wouldn't be an easy task, just glad that I came to ask And that it's good to see his seed again, we laughed and then he grinned Anything for an old friend, anything for an old friend, anything for an old friend So I took on the form of darkness, traveled throughout the cosmic's Hiding from her vengeance so that I remain heartless Make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden I'll make you fuckers understand, bend the knee and kiss the hand Follow me and come this way, I'll lead you to the land Of death and everything uncertain, such a grim reality it's a burden"

Well, it may not be right away But in the meantime Just keep your mind in a positive attitude And while you're waiting, start praising He's gonna see you're through Here's what you gotta do Praise him 'til your blessings come down Praise him 'til your situation turns around You gotta lift up your voice and sing Hallelujah anyway, hallelujah anyway Praise him 'til your blessings come down Praise him 'til your situation turns around You gotta lift up your voice and sing Hallelujah anyway, hallelujah anyway   So much is going on What's taking God so long? Your back is up against the wall Pressure on every side So many nights you cried Wonder if he heard you call? You got to trust him, pe patient He's working behind the scenes Just keep rejoicing, start dancing He's given you the victory Show him that you believe Praise him 'til your blessings come down Praise him 'til your situation turns around You gotta lift up your voice and sing Hallelujah anyway, hallelujah anyway Praise him 'til your blessings come down Praise him 'til your situation turns around You gotta lift up your voice and sing Hallelujah anyway, hallelujah anyway Praise him 'til your blessings come down Praise him 'til your situation turns around You gotta lift up your voice and sing Hallelujah anyway, hallelujah anyway"

        "lyrics": "1  Sketches by Boz illustrative of everyday life and every-day people (Chap. 2.1) LyricsThe StreetsMorning The appearance presented by the streets of London an hour before sunrise, on a summer's morning, is most striking even to the few whose unfortunate pursuits of pleasure, or scarcely less unfortunate pursuits of business, cause them to be well acquainted with the scene. There is an air of cold, solitary desolation about the noiseless streets which we are accustomed to see thronged at other times by a busy, eager crowd, and over the quiet, closely-shut buildings, which throughout the day are swarming with life and bustle, that is very impressive. The last drunken man, who shall find his way home before sunlight, has just staggered heavily along, roaring out the burden of the drinking song of the previous night: the last houseless vagrant whom penury and police have left in the streets, has coiled up his chilly limbs in some paved comer, to dream of food and warmth. The drunken, the dissipated, and the wretched have disappeared; the more sober and orderly part of the population have not yet awakened to the labours of the day, and the stillness of death is over the streets; its very hue seems to be imparted to them, cold and lifeless as they look in the grey, sombre light of daybreak. The coach-stands in the larger thoroughfares are deserted: the night-houses are closed; and the chosen promenades of profligate misery are empty. An occasional policeman may alone be seen at the street corners, listlessly gazing on the deserted prospect before him; and now and then a rakish-looking cat runs stealthily across the road and descends his own area with as much caution and slynessbounding first on the water-butt, then on the dust-hole, and then alighting on the flag-stonesas if he were conscious that his character depended on his gallantry of the preceding night escaping public observation. A partially opened bedroom-window here and there, bespeaks the heat of the weather, and the uneasy slumbers of its occupant; and the dim scanty flicker of the rushlight, through the window-blind, denotes the chamber of watching or sickness. With these few exceptions, the streets present no signs of life, nor the houses of habitation. An hour wears away; the spires of the churches and roofs of the principal buildings are faintly tinged with the light of the rising sun; and the streets, by almost imperceptible degrees, begin to resume their bustle and animation. Market-carts roll slowly along: the sleepy waggoner impatiently urging on his tired horses, or vainly endeavouring to awaken the boy, who, luxuriously stretched on the top of the fruit-baskets, forgets, in happy oblivion, his long-cherished curiosity to behold the wonders of London. Rough, sleepy-looking animals of strange appearance, something between ostlers and hackney-coachmen, begin to take down the shutters of early public-houses; and little deal tables, with the ordinary preparations for a street breakfast, make their appearance at the customary stations. Numbers of men and women (principally the latter), carrying upon their heads heavy baskets of fruit, toil down the park side of Piccadilly, on their way to Covent-garden, and, following each other in rapid succession, form a long straggling line from thence to the turn of the road at Knightsbridge. Here and there, a bricklayer's labourer, with the day's dinner tied up in a handkerchief, walks briskly to his work, and occasionally a little knot of three or four schoolboys on a stolen bathing expedition rattle merrily over the pavement, their boisterous mirth contrasting forcibly with the demeanour of the little sweep, who, having knocked and rung till his arm aches, and being interdicted by a merciful legislature from endangering his lungs by calling out, sits patiently down on the door-step, until the housemaid may happen to awake. Covent-garden market, and the avenues leading to it, are thronged with carts of all sorts, sizes, and descriptions, from the heavy lumbering waggon, with its four stout horses, to the jingling costermonger's cart, with its consumptive donkey. The pavement is already strewed with decayed cabbage-leaves, broken hay-bands, and all the indescribable litter of a vegetable market; men are shouting, carts backing, horses neighing, boys fighting, basket-women talking, piemen expatiating on the excellence of their pastry, and donkeys braying. These and a hundred other sounds form a compound discordant enough to a Londoner's ears, and remarkably disagreeable to those of country gentlemen who are sleeping at the Hummums for the first time. Another hour passes away, and the day begins in good earnest. The servant of all work, who, under the plea of sleeping very soundly, has utterly disregarded Missis's' ringing for half an hour previously, is warned by Master (whom Missis has sent up in his drapery to the landing-place for that purpose), that it's half-past six, whereupon she awakes all of a sudden, with well-feigned astonishment, and goes down-stairs very sulkily, wishing, while she strikes a light, that the principle of spontaneous combustion would extend itself to coals and kitchen range. When the fire is lighted, she opens the street-door to take in the milk, when, by the most singular coincidence in the world, she discovers that the servant next door has just taken in her milk too, and that Mr. Todd's young man over the way, is, by an equally extraordinary chance, taking down his master's shutters. The inevitable consequence is, that she just steps, milk-jug in hand, as far as next door, just to say good morning' to Betsy Clark, and that Mr. Todd's young man just steps over the way to say good morning' to both of 'em; and as the aforesaid Mr. Todd's young man is almost as good-looking and fascinating as the baker himself, the conversation quickly becomes very interesting, and probably would become more so, if Betsy Clark's Missis, who always will be a-followin' her about, didn't give an angry tap at her bedroom window, on which Mr. Todd's young man tries to whistle coolly, as he goes back to his shop much faster than he came from it; and the two girls run back to their respective places, and shut their street-doors with surprising softness, each of them poking their heads out of the front parlour window, a minute afterwards, however, ostensibly with the view of looking at the mail which just then passes by, but really for the purpose of catching another glimpse of Mr. Todd's young man, who being fond of mails, but more of females, takes a short look at the mails, and a long look at the girls, much to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. The mail itself goes on to the coach-office in due course, and the passengers who are going out by the early coach, stare with astonishment at the passengers who are coming in by the early coach, who look blue and dismal, and are evidently under the influence of that odd feeling produced by travelling, which makes the events of yesterday morning seem as if they had happened at least six months ago, and induces people to wonder with considerable gravity whether the friends and relations they took leave of a fortnight before, have altered much since they have left them. The coach-office is all alive, and the coaches which are just going out, are surrounded by the usual crowd of Jews and nondescripts, who seem to consider, Heaven knows why, that it is quite impossible any man can mount a coach without requiring at least sixpenny-worth of oranges, a penknife, a pocket-book, a last year's annual, a pencil-case, a piece of sponge, and a small series of caricatures. Half an hour more, and the sun darts his bright rays cheerfully down the still half-empty streets, and shines with sufficient force to rouse the dismal laziness of the apprentice, who pauses every other minute from his task of sweeping out the shop and watering the pavement in front of it, to tell another apprentice similarly employed, how hot it will be to-day, or to stand with his right hand shading his eyes, and his left resting on the broom, gazing at the Wonder,' or the Tally-ho,' or the Nimrod,' or some other fast coach, till it is out of sight, when he re-enters the shop, envying the passengers on the outside of the fast coach, and thinking of the old red brick house down in the country,' where he went to school: the miseries of the milk and water, and thick bread and scrapings, fading into nothing before the pleasant recollection of the green field the boys used to play in, and the green pond he was caned for presuming to fall into, and other schoolboy associations. Cabs, with trunks and band-boxes between the drivers' legs and outside the apron, rattle briskly up and down the streets on their way to the coach-offices or steam-packet wharfs; and the cab-drivers and hackney-coachmen who are on the stand polish up the ornamental part of their dingy vehiclesthe former wondering how people can prefer them wild beast cariwans of homnibuses, to a riglar cab with a fast trotter,' and the latter admiring how people can trust their necks into one of them crazy cabs, when they can have a 'spectable 'ackney cotche with a pair of 'orses as von't run away with no vun;' a consolation unquestionably founded on fact, seeing that a hackney-coach horse never was known to run at all, except,' as the smart cabman in front of the rank observes, except one, and he run back'ards.' The shops are now completely opened, and apprentices and shopmen are busily engaged in cleaning and decking the windows for the day. The bakers' shops in town are filled with servants and children waiting for the drawing of the first batch of rollsan operation which was performed a full hour ago in the suburbs: for the early clerk population of Somers and Camden towns, Islington, and Pentonville, are fast pouring into the city, or directing their steps towards Chancery-lane and the Inns of Court. Middle-aged men, whose salaries have by no means increased in the same proportion as their families, plod steadily along, apparently with no object in view but the counting-house; knowing by sight almost everybody they meet or overtake, for they have seen them every morning (Sunday excepted) during the last twenty years, but speaking to no one. If they do happen to overtake a personal acquaintance, they just exchange a hurried salutation, and keep walking on either by his side, or in front of him, as his rate of walking may chance to be. As to stopping to shake hands, or to take the friend's arm, they seem to think that as it is not included in their salary, they have no right to do it. Small office lads in large hats, who are made men before they are boys, hurry along in pairs, with their first coat carefully brushed, and the white trousers of last Sunday plentifully besmeared with dust and ink. It evidently requires a considerable mental struggle to avoid investing part of the day's dinner-money in the purchase of the stale tarts so temptingly exposed in dusty tins at the pastry-cooks' doors; but a consciousness of their own importance and the receipt of seven shillings a-week, with the prospect of an early rise to eight, comes to their aid, and they accordingly put their hats a little more on one side, and look under the bonnets of all the milliners' and stay-makers' apprentices they meetpoor girls!the hardest worked, the worst paid, and too often, the worst used class of the community. Eleven o'clock, and a new set of people fill the streets. The goods in the shop-windows are invitingly arranged; the shopmen in their white neckerchiefs and spruce coats, look as it they couldn't clean a window if their lives depended on it; the carts have disappeared from Covent-garden; the waggoners have returned, and the costermongers repaired to their ordinary beats' in the suburbs; clerks are at their offices, and gigs, cabs, omnibuses, and saddle-horses, are conveying their masters to the same destination. The streets are thronged with a vast concourse of people, gay and shabby, rich and poor, idle and industrious; and we come to the heat, bustle, and activity of Noon."

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste And your knee socks The late afternoon, the ghost in your room That you always thought didn't approve of you knockin' boots Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot By the scruff of your knee socks You and me could have been a team Each had a half of a king and queen seat Like the beginning of Mean Streets You could be my baby (Could be my baby) You and me could have been a team Each had a half of a king and queen suite Like the beginning of Mean Streets You could be my baby (Could be my baby) All the zeros lined up You and me could have been a team Each had a half of a king and queen suite Like the beginning of Mean Streets You could be my baby (Could be my baby) But the number's blocked You and me could have been a team Each had a half of a king and queen suite When you've come undone Like the beginning of Mean Streets You could be my baby (Could be my baby) When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste And your knee socks When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste And your knee socks Knee socks Knee socks"

And dance around the room in our scattered point of views Take my hand and breathe, yeah, just count to three I wish that I could blink and turn all your words Into ice cubes so I could fill my drink And I know you know I'm not the one I'm sorry I was late, next time I just won't come   Woo (Ah) Oh man, well, I think I gotta run (Ooh) Well, hey, what's that called When you're sitting on your couch And having fun just being by yourself? Wondering why we can't commit to love The things that we got we always want more of I know you'd rather have me fake it, but I'm not gonna make it Woo (Ah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I gotta run (Ooh) Woo"

'Cause my mind's a minefield of the wretched It's honestly deceptive 'cause   Never mind what you're looking for You'll always find what you're looking for Sometimes it's blinding in the race But I'll be here smiling when I see your face Never mind what you're looking for You're gonna find what you're looking for Sometimes it's blinding in the race But I'll be here smiling when I see your face What you looking for?

Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand-new person But you'll make the same old mistakes Well, I don't care, I'm in love Stop before it's too late I know Feel like a brand-new person But you'll make the same old mistakes I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes) Stop before it's too late I know there's too much at stake Making the same mistakes And I still don't know why it's happening Stop while it's not too late And I still don't know   Finally taking flight I know you don't think it's right I know that you think it's fake Maybe fake's what I like The point is, I have the right Not thinkin' in black and white Thinkin' it's worth the fight Soon I'll be out of sight Knowing it all this time Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand-new person But you'll make the same old mistakes Well, I don't care, I'm in love Stop before it's too late Feel like a brand-new person But you'll make the same old mistakes So how do I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes) Stop before it's too late Man, I know that it's hard to digest But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest And I know it seems wrong to accept But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets Man, I know that it's hard to digest A realization is as good as a guess And I know it seems wrong to accept But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets Feel like a brand-new person So, how will I know that it's right? In a new direction So, how will I know I've gone too far? Stop thinking that the only option was Feel like a brand-new person I finally know what it's like Stop thinking that the only option was In a new direction So how will I know I've gone too far? Stop thinking that the only option was And I know it's hard to describe Stop thinking that the only option was So how will I know that it's right?"

Are you mine? Are you mine? Woah, ah I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days Great escape, lost track of time and space She's a silver lining climbing on my desire And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can't help myself, all I Wanna hear her say is \"Are you mine?\" Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)   And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways So in case, I'm mistaken, I Just wanna hear you say, \"You got me, baby Are you mine?\" She's a silver lining Lone ranger riding through an open space In my mind when she's not right there beside me I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can't help myself, all I Wanna hear her say is \"Are you mine?\" Well, are you mine?

My IQ is way too high to Waste on nonsensical gossip and debates Some call me crazy but I'm just absolute madness This is  Four minutes of elegance Four minutes of excellence Too many intellectually-inept people have strong views concerning politics Too many people want to guide me spiritually when in actuality they're hypocrites Too many people asking for handouts when they lack the discipline to save, invest, or regenerate Too many people borrowing money when they lack the decency to pay back or to simply communicate I stopped beating about the bush, that's the truth, I'm as direct as they come I stopped looking for approval, I'm a youth that's getting past that conundrum My throat is a dungeon I breathe fire, say it right folks I'm a Phoenix, not a dragon I'm a 90's kid I write with the grit I might never fit I mightily spit I'm metaphorically rich So, get these shackles off my feet This is Four minutes of relevance Four minutes of competence For years I have wondered what truly makes a man Is it God, spirituality? I'm trying to understand Money, Power, main babe, side babe, having as many as he can Cause we're all taking risks, calculated or ignorant (ha) Rewards motivate when they are within reach Am I willing to bear the cost for the glory that I seek Love, Peace, Wealth, and a fulfilled destiny Or will I just be all talk if I never reach my peak Every risk that I have taken needed calculation From the courses that I have chosen for the levels of my education All the money that I've invested to build a solid foundation To the affairs of my heart that exceeded infatuation I can't afford to be reckless, no, not in this economy Not when we won't eat love in holy matrimony Not when I plan on raising kids and build a solid family While tens of others look up to me for help and security (ah) What differentiates a man is his ability to think Contemplate, calculate, before you take a risk This is Four minutes of confidence Four minutes of extravagance I listen but I do not just follow anything that seems to be the trend The heart may be deceptive but I've seen brothers stick closer than a friend There's power in consistency, even bliss may come to an end Because when the flower isn't watered, it soon starts to bend A lot of love has been lost and my city is well known to devour the spoil He prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies So, before you ask me what I bring to the table I ask, do you even have a cup to collect this overflowing oil This is Four minutes of acceptance Four minutes of repentance Lord knows I'm sick with the flow This is my heartbeat on an instrumental Lord, I know I'm sick and flawed So, heal my heart, come heal my mental 'Don't judge a book by its cover This law you cannot deny Don't cover a judge by his books There's more than what meets the eye They thought I stopped writing, I heard them criticize But how can someone quit their passion, that can never be wise It is ignorance to watch me burn and think I will never rise The sun may set in the west but even Kanye knows the direction of every sunrise It's Phinix (So Good)"

Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind I have so much to say, but you're so far away Sleep tight, I'm not afraid (Not afraid) The ones that we love are here with me Lay away a place for me (Place for me) 'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way (On my way) To live eternally How do I live without the ones I love? Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind And the light you left remains, but it's so hard to stay When I have so much to say, and you're so far away I love you, you were ready The pain is strong, and urges rise But I'll see you when He lets me Your pain is gone, your hands untied So far away And I need you to know So far away And I need you to, need you to know"

        "lyrics": "Is a Very Short One, and May Appear Of No Great Importance In Its Place, But It Should Be Read Notwithstanding, As A Sequel to the Last, And a Key to One That Will Follow When Its Time Arrives 'And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?' said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table. 'Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!' 'You will tell me a different tale one of these days,' said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason. 'I hope I may have good cause to do so,' replied Mr. Losberne; 'though I confess I don't think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?' 'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver. 'That's a fine fellow,' said the doctor; 'you shall come and see me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?' 'The great nobs,' replied Harry, 'under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.' 'Well,' said the doctor, 'you are a queer fellow. But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. There's something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.' Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, 'We shall see,' and pursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed. 'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, 'let me speak a word with you.' Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed. 'You can write well now?' said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm. 'I hope so, sir,' replied Oliver. 'I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to mesay once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. Will you?' 'Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,' exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission. 'I should like to know howhow my mother and Miss Maylie are,' said the young man; 'and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether shethey, I meanseem happy and quite well. You understand me?' 'Oh! quite, sir, quite,' replied Oliver. 'I would rather you did not mention it to them,' said Harry, hurrying over his words; 'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.' Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection. The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage. 'Drive on!' he cried, 'hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.' 'Halloa!' cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; 'something very short of flying will keep pace with me. Do you hear?' Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed. And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself. 'He seems in high spirits and happy,' she said, at length. 'I feared for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.' Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy."

Something's getting in the way Something's just about to break I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane So, tell me how it should be Try to find out what makes you tick as I lie down Sore and sick Do you like that? Do you like that? There's a fine line between love and hate And I don't mind, just let me say that I like that I like that Something's getting in the way Somthing's just about to break I will try to find my place in the diary of Jan As I burn another page As I look the other way I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane So, tell me how it should be See Breaking Benjamin LiveGet tickets as low as $75  Desperate, I will crawl Waiting for so long No love, there is no love Die for anyone What have I become?! Something's getting in the way Something's just about to break I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane As I burn another page As I look the other way I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane"
